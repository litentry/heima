A parachain is an application-specific data structure that is globally coherent and validatable by the validators of the relaychain. They take their name from the concept of parallelized chains that run parallel to the relaychain. Most commonly, a parachain will take the form of a blockchain, but there is no specific need for them to be actual blockchains.

Basically, parachains are layer-1 blockchains that connect to the relaychains (Polkadot or Kusama), which validates the state transition of connected parachains, providing a shared state across the entire ecosystem. Since the validator set on the relaychain is expected to be secure with a large amount of stake put up to back it, it is desirable for parachains to benefit from this shared security.

To achieve identity aggregation, Litentry has a requirement to store sensitive user data, like web3 addresses, computed credit scores, and VCs in the trusted execution environment (TEE). Litentry builds a TEE sidechain for this purpose and it can be composed of multiple TEE-equipped nodes, to guarantee the security of data storage and data processing without exposing users' private data. A core component of this is the Litentry TEE worker which is based on Integritee's worker. It executes functions with specified inputs and resource limits in response to TEE calls and operations to ensure a sufficient level of scaling.

To serve as the backbone platform for various Litentry products and achieve a transparent and decentralized user experience, we have different chain-specs/runtimes compiled into one single binary. They are:

- litentry-parachain-runtime (on polkadot)
- rococo-parachain-runtime (on rococo testnet)

Therefore, when building node binary or docker image, no distinction is required. But when building runtime/starting binary/running tests, the chain type must be explicitly given. See the examples below.

## Lists of make targets

Simply run

```
make help
```

to see the full lists of market targets and their short descriptions.

## Build parachain

To build the binary:

```
make build-node
```

To build the `litentry/litentry-parachain` docker image:

```
make build-docker-release
or
make build-docker-production
```

they will use `release` or `production` cargo profile, respectively.

To build the litentry-parachain runtime wasm:

```
make build-runtime-litentry
```

The wasms should be located under `target/release/wbuild/litentry-parachain-runtime/`

Similarly, use `make build-runtime-rococo` to build the rococo-parachain-runtime.

## Launch parachain
### Launch a parachain network with relaychains

Litentry takes use of zombinet(https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet) to spin up local networks with 2 relaychain nodes and 1 parachain node:
```
make launch-network-litentry`
```
It will firstly look for the `litentry-collator` binary under `target/release/`, if not found, it will try to copy binaries out from `litentry/litentry-parachain:latest` image if you are on Linux.

When finished with the network, run

```
make clean-network
```

to stop the processes and tidy things up.

### Launch a standalone parachain node

To speed up the development, it's possible to launch the parachain without relaychain.
In this case, parachain will author blocks by itself with instant block finalisation, please refer to [this PR](https://github.com/litentry/litentry-parachain/pull/1059).

```
make launch-standalone
```

## How to build and run tee-worker

### Preparation

- Env: [Setup **SGX TEE** Environment](https://web3builders.notion.site/Setup-SGX-TEE-Environment-68066770831b45b7b632e682cf159477?pvs=4) 

### Build

```
cd /tee-worker
source /opt/intel/sgxsdk/environment
SGX_MODE=SW WORKER_DEV=1 make
```

### Launch

Before executing `launch.py`, the following Python libraries need to be installed
```
pip install python-dotenv pycurl docker toml
```

TEE-workers need a running parachain to become operational. We have an all-in-one script `local-setup/launch.py` to launch both parachain and workers:
```
./local-setup/launch.py -p standalone
./local-setup/launch.py -p network
./local-setup/launch.py -p remote
```

They stand for different parachain launching options:
- standalone parachain
- parachain network with relaychains
- parachain is remotely launched (elsewhere), so don't launch parachain in `launch.py`
respectively.

### TEE Worker Tests 

Refer to [tee-worker ts-tests](https://github.com/litentry/litentry-parachain/blob/dev/tee-worker/ts-tests/README.md)

### Clean-up

In the worker launch terminal, `Ctrl + C` should interrupt and clean everything up automatically.

### How to know the Worker is Working

In logs, youâ€™ll see the sidechain starts to produce blocks

### Additional Info:

1. Change the RUST_LOG level: `litentry-parachain/local-setup/py/worker.py`
2. Check existing ts-tests: `litentry-parachain/tee-worker/ts-tests/package.json`
3. JSON config parameters: `litentry-parachain/tee-worker/service/src/cli.yml`
