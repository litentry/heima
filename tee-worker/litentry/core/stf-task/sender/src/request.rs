/// Here a few Request structs are defined for asynchronously stf-tasks handling.
/// A `callback` exists for some request types to submit a callback TrustedCall to top pool.
/// We use the encoded version just to avoid cyclic dependency, otherwise we have
/// ita-stf -> lc-stf-task-sender -> ita-stf
///
/// In this way we make sure the state is processed "chronologically" by the StfExecutor.
/// We can't write any state in this state, otherwise we can be trapped into a situation
/// where the state doesn't match the apriori state that is recorded before executing any
/// trusted calls in block production (InvalidAprioriHash error).
///
/// Reading state is not a problem. However, we prefer to read the required storage before
/// sending the stf-task and pass it as parameters in `Request`, e.g. `challenge_code` below.
/// The reason is we actually want the "snapshot" state when the preflight TrustedCall gets
/// executed instead of the "live" state.
///
/// The callback TrustedCall will be appended to the end of top pool but we don't see a
/// problem. In case some preflight TrustedCall and callback TrustedCall are going to change
/// the same storage, we should implement them carefully and always treat it as if both
/// TrustedCalls can get executed in any order.
